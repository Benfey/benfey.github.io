The setup is pretty minimal - Jekyll on GitHub Pages with a dark theme that I actually like looking at. Should make it easy to just drop markdown files here whenever I want to write about:

- Papers I've read
- Tools I'm experimenting with
- Random AI thoughts and observations
- Code experiments and results
- The implications of AI

Let's see if styling works:

## Code blocks work nicely

```python
def hello_ai():
    print("Ready to write about AI stuff!")
```

**Bold text** and _italic text_ look good. Links should work too.

> Block quotes for when I want to highlight something important from a paper

Time to start writing actual content!
